# Ajax-Project

Goal: To create a web application with just basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Using Bootstrap 5) to perform CRUD operations.

CRUD operations are the four basic operations of manipulating data including Create/Construct, Read, Update and Delete. 
Furthermore, CRUD operations were performed by the use of an external API  from MeCallAPI.com.

To read data with JavaScript, I used AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) technique to have my web site update asynchronously. 
Concretely, data would exchange using API in the background. Thus, the data is retrieved, and the web page is updated without doing a refresh.

To make the application look pretty, Bootstrap and Sweetalert was used(for easily creating nice popups using JavaScript)
But for some reason my sweetalert cdn didn't work. So, currently the application only performs Read operation.
